- Provide a design system that keeps the site consistent as it grows.

## Repository Structure
- `assets/pictures` – general imagery and photography for the site.
- `assets/logos` – logo variations, iconography, and brand marks.
- `assets/designs` – design exports (e.g., Figma frames, PDFs) that guide implementation.
- Additional app folders (frontend, backend, etc.) will be added as development progresses.
